### Connect nodes

You can connect nodes, by hovering the border of any node, press and hold the small connector circle and drag it over another node. A connection is made, provided that node types are compatible.

You may also drag out from the connector circle to empty canvas space. The radial menu will open with all nodes, that are connection-compatible to the starting node. A connection is then automatically created between these two nodes.
